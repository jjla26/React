## Module 1 Intro Video

Welcome to Module 1.
In this module, we're gonna start off
by talking about what is ReactJS and why you should use it.
Moving forward, we're gonna talk about React Elements and
how they are the building blocks that represent DOM nodes.
After that, we're gonna talk about JSX,
which is a syntax extension that allows you to write
HTML code in your JavaScript.
After that, we're gonna talk about functional components
which are independent reasonable components that describe how
the UI should look like based on its state and properties.
And lastly, we're gonna learn how to arrange functional
components to model an application in an efficient and
clean manner.

The following steps are used to add ReactJS to an HTML file:

1. Create an HTML file

```[html]

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">

 
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```
2. Add scripts to include react.js, react-dom.js and babel.js inside the head of the HTML file

```[html]
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@15/dist/react.min.js"></script>
       <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@15/dist/react-dom.min.js"></script>
       <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-standalone/6.24.0/babel.js"></script>

  </head>
  <body>
  
  </body>
</html>
```

3. Add a babel script within the body of the HTML file

```[html]
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@15/dist/react.min.js"></script>
       <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@15/dist/react-dom.min.js"></script>
       <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-standalone/6.24.0/babel.js"></script>

  </head>
  <body>

      <script type="text/babel">

      </script>
  
  </body>
</html>
```

4. Add <div id="root></div> to the body of the HTML file

```[html]
!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@15/dist/react.min.js"></script>
       <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@15/dist/react-dom.min.js"></script>
       <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-standalone/6.24.0/babel.js"></script>

  </head>
  <body>
      <div id="root"></div>
      <script type="text/babel">

      </script>
  
  </body>
</html>
```

5. Start rendering elements using ReactJS

```[html]

!DOCTYPE html>

What is ReactJS?

ReactJS is a library that generates the view layer of an application based on its state. ReactJS applications are built from React Components - independent resusable components that describe how the UI should look based on their own state and properties.

Why should I use ReactJS?

ReactJS applications are incredibly performant at UI rerendering
React Components make writing UI components easier
What makes ReactJS so efficient at rerendering?

React Components are used to generate a Virtual DOM - a light-weight abstraction of the actual HTML DOM. The Virtual DOM is able to be generated much more quickly than the HTML DOM because it does not have to calculate CSS styles and layouts. When a React Component changes state, the Virtual DOM is recreated and the difference between the new Virtual DOM and the previous Virtual DOM is calculated. The ReactJS library then calculates the most efficient way to update the HTML DOM to reflect these changes. This ends up being much faster than regenerating the entire HTML DOM from the top.

Virtual DOM

How hard is it to use ReactJS?

ReactJS is a relatively lightweight library and it does not take a whole lot of code to get started with it.

Here is an example of the code needed for a Hello World application:

   <div id="root"></div>

    ReactDOM.render(
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>,
        document.getElementById("root")
    )

ReactJS is a library that generates the view layer of
an application based on its state.
ReactJS applications are built from React Components,
independent reusable components that describe how the UI should
look based on their State and their Properties.
So, why should you use ReactJS?
Well, ReactJS applications are incredibly performant at UI
rendering, and also,
React components make writing UI components easy.
So, what makes ReactJS so efficient at rerendering?
Well, React components are used to generate a virtual DOM,
a lightweight abstraction of the actual HTML DOM.
The virtual DOM is able to be generated much more
quickly than the HTML DOM because it does not have to
do a bunch of calculations with the CSS styles and the layout.
When a React component changes state, the virtual DOM
is recreated, and the difference between the old virtual DOM and
the new virtual DOM is calculated.
The ReactJS library then calculates
the most efficient way to update the HTML DOM and
changes only what is necessary for the view to be updated.
This ends up being much faster than just rewriting
the HTML DOM from the top.
So, how hard is it to use ReactJS?
ReactJS is actually a relatively lightweight library and
does not take a whole lot of code to get started.
So, if you're ready to begin, let's continue on and
learn how to write a ReactJS application.


# Curso   Module 1 | JSX and React Components   Rendering Elements   Rendering Elements

Rendering Elements
Marcar esta p치gina
React Elements

React Elements are objects that represent a DOM node. They are written using a syntax extension named JSX which we will cover later in this module. React Elements are different than React Components, which we will also cover later in this module.


    var element = <h1>Hello World!</h1>
React Elements need to be rendered by the ReactDOM.render() method to appear in the DOM.

ReactDOM.render()

The ReactDOM.render() method is used to render a React Element into a specified part of the HTML DOM. In most React applications, there is usually a single root node where everything gets rendered into, but you may use as many root nodes as you desire.

In this case, the <h1>Hello World!</h1> React Element is rendered into the DOM element with the id of "root".

   <div id="root"></div>

    ReactDOM.render(
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>,
        document.getElementById("root")
    )
Rerendering the DOM using additional render() calls

Once a DOM is rendered, it will remain the same until another render() method is called.

The following example uses additional render() calls to update the displayed number:


    var num = 0;

    function updateNum(){

        ReactDOM.render(
            <div>{num++}</div>,
            document.getElementById("root")
        )
    }

   setInterval(updateNum,100)
   
# Curso   Module 1 | JSX and React Components   Rendering Elements   Rendering Elements Video

Rendering Elements Video

React elements are the building blocks of react JS applications.
A react element is an object that represents a DomNode.
React elements are written using JSX
which is a JavaScript extension,
that allows us to write HTML tags in our JavaScript code.
So let's take a look at what that looks like.
As you can see here in the code, I've written an HTML tag with,
Hello World, inside it.
And I define that to the element variable.
This is something that JSX allows us to do.
Now that we've created our react element,
how do we render it to the page?
Well, if we first look at HTML we'll see that we have a single
div element within id of roots.
We can target this div and embed our react element inside of it.
And we can do that with the ReactDom.render method.
Let me show you how that works.
The ReactDom.render method takes in two arguments.
The first being the element that we're trying to render, and
the second being the target.
So, if we target that root element we saw earlier and
we embed our react element,
we can see that Hello World is now rendered to the page.
So once a DOM is rendered it will remain the same
until another ReactDOM.render method is called.
So, if we happen to change this element variable,
the page would not re-render.
We will have to recall another render method.

# Curso   Module 1 | JSX and React Components   JSX   JSX

JSX
Marcar esta p치gina
What is JSX?

JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows React Elements to be written inside JavaScript using HTML tags.

Using JSX, we can create React Elements easily with HTML Tags:
```[JSX]
    var element = <h1>Hello World!</h1>
```

Without JSX, the process is much slower and more verbose:

```[JSX]
    var element = React.createElement(
        'h1',
        null,
        'Hello World!'
    )
    ```
Using JSX with JavaScript Expressions

Curly braces can be used to embed JavaScript expressions into JSX.

The following are all examples of valid JavaScript expressions in JSX:
```[JSX]
    var str = "World!" 

    var element =  <h1> Hello {str}</h1>
    var item = {
        name: "Cheese",
        price: 5
    }
    var element
    t = <p>{item.name} : ${item.price} </p>
    var length = 20
    var width = 10

    function calculateArea(x,y){
        return x * y
    }

    var element = <div>The Area is: {calculateArea(length,width)}</div>

```
Using JSX with Attributes

You can supply attribute values using a string literal surrounded by quotes:
```[JSX]
    var element = <button className ="deleteButton"> Delete </button>
```
You can also supply attributes values by embedding a JavaScript expression using curly braces:
```[JSX]
    var element = <img src ={product.imageURL}></img>
```
Do not surround curly braces with quotes. This will cause your expression to be treated as a string literal:
```[JSX]
    //Do not do this
    var element = <img src ="{product.imageURL}"></img>
```
Some common HTML attributes are named differently in JSX. For example "class" becomes "className" because "class" is a reserved keyword in JavaScript. Furthermore, attribute names in JSX follow the camelCase naming convention so an HTML attribute such as fontsize would become fontSize in JSX.

Using JSX with Empty Tags

If a HTML tag is empty, you can close it with a '/>' instead of using a closing tag.

For example:
```[JSX]
    var element = <input className ="nameInput"/>
```

Using JSX with a Style Object

The style attribute can be populated with a style object instead of a string literal

For example:
```[JSX]
    var styleObject = {
        backgroundColor: 'red',
        color:'blue',
        fontSize: 25,
        width: 100
    }

    var element = <input style = {styleObject}/>
```
In this next example, the first set of curly braces is for the JSX expression while the second set of curly braces is for the style object:
```[JSX]
    var element = <input style = {{width:200,height:100}}/>
```
Using JSX with Nested Elements

React Elements can be nested within other React Elements as long as the whole thing is wrapped by in a single element.

For example:
```[JSX]
    var element = (
        <div>
            <div>Hello World</div>
            <div>Hello World</div>
        </div>

    )
    ```
This example is not surrounded with a single wrapping element and will throw an error:
```[JSX]
    var element = (
        <div>Hello World</div>
        <div>Hello World</div>
    )
    ```
It is recommended to surround nested elements with paranthesis to avoid the problems that occur with automatic semicolon insertion.

Using JSX Objects

Objects created with JSX can be manipulated just like normal JavaScript objects. They can be passed in arrays, used as arguments or return statements to functions and used inside if statements or for loops.

An example using JSX objects within an If Else statement:

```[JSX]
    var product = {name:"apple",stock:0}

    if(product.stock < 0){
        var element = <h1>The product named {product.name} is not in stock</h1>
    }
    else{
        var element = <h1>The product named {product.name} and has {product.stock} units in stock</h1>
    }

    ReactDOM.render(
        element,
        document.getElementById("root")
    )
    
    ```
    
# Curso   Module 1 | JSX and React Components   JSX   JSX Video

JSX Video

JSX is a syntax extension that allows us to write
HTML tags in our JavaScript code.
Without JSX, it is much,
much more verbose to write React elements.
So let's take a look at these examples.
The first line uses JSX.
Well, the second one doesn't.
And as you can see it's a lot more effort.
So, that's why JSX is preferred
when we want some correct React elements.
Curly braces allows us to embed JavaScript expressions
into our JSX code.
Let's take a look at example.
So, over here we have the string variable and
we have an item object.
We can embed these into our HTML tag using curly braces.
So, let's start with the string.
So, by putting the string variable name inside the curly
braces, we can now see that string has been
embedded into our page.
So, if we want to reference the item.name and
item.price you can do so in a similar fashion.
And as you can see here the item.name and price have also
been rendered by us using JSX expressions with curly braces.
Now lastly, we can also use functions in our curly braces.
So, for example, if we use this calculateArea function
that I wrote below, and put in some numbers.
We can see that functions can also be used in our
curly braces.
You can supply attribute values using a string literal
surrounded by quotes.
You can also supply attribute values by embedding a JavaScript
expression using curly braces.
However, do not surround the curly braces with quotes.
This will cause the expression to be
treated as a string literal.
And one last thing is that certain attributes
are named differently in JSX.
For example, class in HTML becomes className.
Multiple React elements can be rendered at the same time
as long as there is one enclosing element that surrounds
all of the React elements.
So, in this case, we have a div element that encloses
both the Hello world divs.
However, if we got rid of that div then it wouldn't work.
    
# Curso   Module 1 | JSX and React Components   Functional Components   Functional Components

Functional Components
Marcar esta p치gina
React Components

A React Component is an independent reusable component that outputs a React Element based on its properties and state.

There are two types of React Components:

Functional Components
Class Components
Class Components have state, lifecycle methods, and properties while Functional Components only have properties. In this module, we will cover Functional Components while Class Components will be covered in Module 2.

Functional Components

Functional Components are just functions that output React Elements. By convention, the first letter of the function name should be capitalized.

Here is an example:
```[JSX]
    function HelloWorld(){
        return <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    }
    
```
You can use the React Component in JSX by creating an HTML tag with the same name as the React Component:
```[JSX]
    var element = <HelloWorld/>
```
Another Example:
```[JSX]
   ReactDOM.render(
        <HelloWorld/>,
        document.getElementById("root")
    )
    ```
These examples will all evaluate to the React Element that is returned by the HelloWorld Component.

Adding Properties to Functional Components

The first argument to a Functional Component is an object that contains the component's properties.
```[JSX]
    function HelloWorld(props){
        return <h1>Message: {props.message}</h1>
    }
    ```
You can supply property values the same way as you supply attribute values:
```[JSX]
   ReactDOM.render(
        <HelloWorld message="Hello World!"/>,
        document.getElementById("root")
    )
    ```
Properties can be string literals, arrays or any other type of JavaScript object including other React Elements:
```[JSX]
    function HelloWorld(props){
        return <h1>Value: {props.numberArray[props.index]} </h1>
    }

    ReactDOM.render(
        <HelloWorld index = "3" numberArray={[1,2,3,4,5]}/>,
        document.getElementById("root")
    )
    ```
You can supply as many property values as you want and they will all be accessible through the props argument.

# Curso   Module 1 | JSX and React Components   Functional Components   Functional Components Video

Functional Components Video

A React component is an independent reusable component
that returns a react element based on its properties and
its state.
There are two types of React components, class components and
functional components.
However, for now we're gonna cover functional components,
as its name suggests, functional components are written similarly
to JavaScript functions.
Let's write one right now, Over here I am declaring
a functional components named HelloWorld in this components
will return a header with Hello World inside it.
Now how do we use this functional component?
Well in our ReactDOM.render function, we can put a tag
with the functional component's name as the tag name.
So in this case, it would be a tag with HelloWorld in it.
And as we can see,
our React component is now rendered to the page.
Now we can add properties to this React component by adding
props as an argument.
The individual properties have to be supplied in a way similar
to how attributes are declared.
So if we have a property called message,
you can assign that to something like My Message.
And then, in our functional component we can use
the curly brace notation to refer to that property.
And as you can see here,
the message property was supplied and it was,
It was referenced by the props.message attribute.

# Curso   Module 1 | JSX and React Components   Composition   Composition

Composition

Functional Components can include other Functional Components in their output. This lets us keep our components organized and readible.

For example, look at this Shopping Application that makes use of Composition:

```[react]
    function ShoppingTitle(props){
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>{props.title}</h1>
                <h2>Total Number of Items: {props.numItems}</h2>
            </div>

        ) 
    }
    function ListItem(props){
        return <li>{props.item}</li>
    }


    function ShoppingList(props){
        return (
            <div>
                <h3>{props.header}</h3>
                <ol>
                    <ListItem item = {props.items[0]}/>
                    <ListItem item = {props.items[1]}/>
                    <ListItem item = {props.items[2]}/>
                </ol>
            </div>
        )
    }


    function ShoppingApp(props){

        return (
            <div>
                <ShoppingTitle title = "My Shopping List" numItems = "9"/>
                <ShoppingList header = "Food" items = {[ "Apple","Bread","Cheese"]}/>
                <ShoppingList header = "Clothes" items = {[ "Shirt","Pants","Hat"]}/>
                <ShoppingList header = "Supplies" items = {[ "Pen","Paper","Glue"]}/>
            </div>
        )
    }

    ReactDOM.render(
        <ShoppingApp/>,
        document.getElementById("root")
    )
    
```

Compare that to just defining all the UI in one Functional Component.

```[react]
    function ShoppingApp(props){
        return (
            <div>
                <div>
                    <h1>My Shopping List</h1>
                    <h2>Total Number of Items: 9</h2>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Food</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Apple</li>
                        <li>Bread</li>
                        <li>Cheese</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3>Clothes</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Shirt</li>
                        <li>Pants</li>
                        <li>Hat</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3>Supplies</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Pen</li>
                        <li>Paper</li>
                        <li>Glue</li>

    )
```

# Curso   Module 1 | JSX and React Components   Composition   Composition Video

Composition Video

Functional components can include
other functional components in their outputs.
Using this, we can model our application using a hierarchy
of functional components.
This allows us to keep our code clean and maintainable.
So let's look at this functional component over here that's named
ShoppingApp.
Inside we can see that there is a lot of HTML tags, and
it's kind of hard to maintain.
It's output is a shopping list that contains three
separate lists.
So what we wanna do is see if we can extract smaller
functional components out of this large functional component.
So to do this, let's look for things that repeat itself.
So we can see that we could break this down into a shopping
title that has this two different headers.
We could break this down to three different shopping lists
over here, and each shopping list can have a title and
three line items.
So let's model it that way.
So let's start with the line items.
So here I'm making a functional component called LineItem.
And I'm just gonna return an li tag.
I'll fill this out later once we have a bigger picture of
the overall application.
So next,
I'm gonna make the ShoppingList functional component that will,
Return the list that has a title and three line items.
So I'll start by returning a div that encompasses everything and
then I'll put in the header.
And then the three line items.
And let's copy that three times.
And make it look pretty.
Okay, and then let's continue on and
make the functional component for the shopping title.
And this'll return a div that encompasses
everything, and then a header for
the title and another header for,
The total number of items.
Okay, now we can make a function component that holds
all of these components.
So, let's name it MyShoppingApp,
to differentiate it from the existing ShoppingApp.
And, Let's fill it out.
So first we're going to have a div that encompasses everything,
then we're gonna put in our shopping title.
Followed by our shopping lists.
And let's put three of those.
Okay, so now that we have our overall structure,
we need to populate it with data so
that it resembles the original shopping list.
Well, so, let's start with the title.
So we have a title property and
let's call it My New Shopping List.
And then we have total number of items,
let's call that numItems and set that equal to 9.
And for our ShoppingList components, we will put in
a title and then an array that includes all of the line items.
So let's put in the title, Food, and then add the line items.
Let's call them items, and create an array.
And let's copy this, Three times.
And this one will have Apple, Bread, Cheese.
This one will have Shirt, Pants, Hat.
And this one will have Pen,
Paper, Glue.
This will be Clothes.
And this will be Supplies.
Okay, so now that we have our data in our top level component,
let's trickle it down to our other components.
So ShoppingTitle is gonna have props.title here.
And then it'll have total number of
items and then props.num items.
Okay, then our ShoppingList we will have
our title here, so props.title.
And then in each individual line item, we're gonna set
another property, the item property, to be the props.items.
And then reference it by the index we want.
So this would be 0, and then we do this three times.
And this will be 1 and 2.
And then, lastly, our list item will have props.item.
Okay, so now we can reference MyShoppingApp instead of
ShoppingApp and see if, and there we have it.
It worked, because we can see that the title changed to
My New Shopping List.
And if we compare the two, this shopping
app is much more maintainable than this shopping app.

Conditional Rendering

The output of a Functional Component can be determined based on its properties.

For example:
```[react]

    function Feature(props){
        if (props.active == true){
            return <h1>This feature is active</h1>
        }
        else{
            return <h1>This feature is not active</h1>
        }

    }
    ```
This can also be accomplished using an inline conditional operator:
```[react]

    function Feature(props){
        return <h1>This feature is {props.active? "active" : "not active"}</h1>
    }
    
```

Preventing Rendering

The output of a Functional Component can be prevented from rendering.

For example:

```[react]
    function Feature(props){
        if(props.active!){
            return null
        }
        else{
            return <h1>{props.message}</h1>
        }
    }
    ```
You can also conditionally prevent a feature from rendering using the && operator:
```[react]
    function Feature(props){
        return (
            props.active && <h1>{props.message}</h1>
        )
    }
    ```
With the && operator, true and expression will always evaluate to expression. On the other hand, false and expression will always evaluate to false which won't render.

Conditional Rendering Video

Using conditional rendering, we can make the output
of a functional component depend on its properties.
So if we have functional component named Feature and
it has a property named active,
we can change the output whether active is true or false.
So let's set it to true for this first example.
And then we will use some if statements to make the output
depending on whether it's true or false.
So if(props.active == true) we'll make the output,
This feature is ON.
And if otherwise, we can make it, This feature is OFF.
So since it's true, it's saying This feature is ON.
But if we change this to false,
the component now says This feature is OFF.
So we can also do this in one line using
the in-line conditional operator.
So if we return, This feature is, and
then put in our conditional operator, props.active.
It has to be surrounded by curly braces since it's a JavaScript
expression.
So props.active, And
then put in "ON":"OFF".
And as you can see,
it has the same results as that if statement.
If we change it to true, it goes This features ON.
The outputs of a functional component can also be prevented
from rendering.
So in this example let's pretend there is a feature component and
it has a property called active.
And let's set that to false.
If we write an if statement that checks if props.active == false,
and then we return null, then nothing will be rendered.
And if it is active, then we can return something else,
This feature is active.
So for now since active is false and
it returns null, nothing gets rendered.
But if we change it to true, the feature will be rendered.
This can also be done using the double ampersand operator.
So if we wrote,
return props.active
&& this React element,
it will check if props.active is true.
And if this is true, then it will render the whole thing.
But if this is false, It won't render it.
And the way this works is because with the double
ampersand operator, true and
an expression will always evaluate to the expression.
While false and the expression will always evaluate to false,
which gets converted to null and then doesn't render.
