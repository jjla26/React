## Module 1 Intro Video

Welcome to Module 1.
In this module, we're gonna start off
by talking about what is ReactJS and why you should use it.
Moving forward, we're gonna talk about React Elements and
how they are the building blocks that represent DOM nodes.
After that, we're gonna talk about JSX,
which is a syntax extension that allows you to write
HTML code in your JavaScript.
After that, we're gonna talk about functional components
which are independent reasonable components that describe how
the UI should look like based on its state and properties.
And lastly, we're gonna learn how to arrange functional
components to model an application in an efficient and
clean manner.

The following steps are used to add ReactJS to an HTML file:

1. Create an HTML file

```[html]

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">

 
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```
2. Add scripts to include react.js, react-dom.js and babel.js inside the head of the HTML file

```[html]
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@15/dist/react.min.js"></script>
       <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@15/dist/react-dom.min.js"></script>
       <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-standalone/6.24.0/babel.js"></script>

  </head>
  <body>
  
  </body>
</html>
```

3. Add a babel script within the body of the HTML file

```[html]
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@15/dist/react.min.js"></script>
       <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@15/dist/react-dom.min.js"></script>
       <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-standalone/6.24.0/babel.js"></script>

  </head>
  <body>

      <script type="text/babel">

      </script>
  
  </body>
</html>
```

4. Add <div id="root></div> to the body of the HTML file

```[html]
!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@15/dist/react.min.js"></script>
       <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@15/dist/react-dom.min.js"></script>
       <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-standalone/6.24.0/babel.js"></script>

  </head>
  <body>
      <div id="root"></div>
      <script type="text/babel">

      </script>
  
  </body>
</html>
```

5. Start rendering elements using ReactJS

```[html]

!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@15/dist/react.min.js"></script>
       <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@15/dist/react-dom.min.js"></script>
       <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-standalone/6.24.0/babel.js"></script>

  </head>
  <body>
      <div id="root"></div>
      <script type="text/babel">
          ReactDOM.render(
              <div>Hello World</div>,
              document.getElementById("root")
          )
      </script>
  
  </body>
</html>
```

We will be using CodePen to submit our lab assignments in this edX course. Codepen is used so other students can have an easier time viewing and testing your lab submissions. 



Link to CodePen with ReactJS set up

The following steps are used to set up ReactJS to work in CodePen:

1. Go to https://codepen.io/pen to open a new project

2. Click Settings

3. Click JavaScript and under JavaScript Preprocessor select Babel

4. Click Quick-add and select React

5. Click Quick-add and select React-DOM (this must be selected after React or your app won't work)

 Once you have completed the above steps, add the following to get started:

In HTML:

<div id="root"></div>

In JavaScript:

ReactDOM.render(

    <div>Hello World</div>,

    document.getElementById("root")

)

What is ReactJS?

ReactJS is a library that generates the view layer of an application based on its state. ReactJS applications are built from React Components - independent resusable components that describe how the UI should look based on their own state and properties.

Why should I use ReactJS?

ReactJS applications are incredibly performant at UI rerendering
React Components make writing UI components easier
What makes ReactJS so efficient at rerendering?

React Components are used to generate a Virtual DOM - a light-weight abstraction of the actual HTML DOM. The Virtual DOM is able to be generated much more quickly than the HTML DOM because it does not have to calculate CSS styles and layouts. When a React Component changes state, the Virtual DOM is recreated and the difference between the new Virtual DOM and the previous Virtual DOM is calculated. The ReactJS library then calculates the most efficient way to update the HTML DOM to reflect these changes. This ends up being much faster than regenerating the entire HTML DOM from the top.

Virtual DOM

How hard is it to use ReactJS?

ReactJS is a relatively lightweight library and it does not take a whole lot of code to get started with it.

Here is an example of the code needed for a Hello World application:

   <div id="root"></div>

    ReactDOM.render(
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>,
        document.getElementById("root")
    )

What is ReactJS Video


ReactJS is a library that generates the view layer of
an application based on its state.
ReactJS applications are built from React Components,
independent reusable components that describe how the UI should
look based on their State and their Properties.
So, why should you use ReactJS?
Well, ReactJS applications are incredibly performant at UI
rendering, and also,
React components make writing UI components easy.
So, what makes ReactJS so efficient at rerendering?
Well, React components are used to generate a virtual DOM,
a lightweight abstraction of the actual HTML DOM.
The virtual DOM is able to be generated much more
quickly than the HTML DOM because it does not have to
do a bunch of calculations with the CSS styles and the layout.
When a React component changes state, the virtual DOM
is recreated, and the difference between the old virtual DOM and
the new virtual DOM is calculated.
The ReactJS library then calculates
the most efficient way to update the HTML DOM and
changes only what is necessary for the view to be updated.
This ends up being much faster than just rewriting
the HTML DOM from the top.
So, how hard is it to use ReactJS?
ReactJS is actually a relatively lightweight library and
does not take a whole lot of code to get started.
So, if you're ready to begin, let's continue on and
learn how to write a ReactJS application.

Rendering Elements

React Elements

React Elements are objects that represent a DOM node. They are written using a syntax extension named JSX which we will cover later in this module. React Elements are different than React Components, which we will also cover later in this module.


    var element = <h1>Hello World!</h1>
React Elements need to be rendered by the ReactDOM.render() method to appear in the DOM.

ReactDOM.render()

The ReactDOM.render() method is used to render a React Element into a specified part of the HTML DOM. In most React applications, there is usually a single root node where everything gets rendered into, but you may use as many root nodes as you desire.

In this case, the <h1>Hello World!</h1> React Element is rendered into the DOM element with the id of "root".

   <div id="root"></div>

    ReactDOM.render(
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>,
        document.getElementById("root")
    )
Rerendering the DOM using additional render() calls

Once a DOM is rendered, it will remain the same until another render() method is called.

The following example uses additional render() calls to update the displayed number:


    var num = 0;

    function updateNum(){

        ReactDOM.render(
            <div>{num++}</div>,
            document.getElementById("root")
        )
    }

   setInterval(updateNum,100)

Rendering Elements Video

React elements are the building blocks of react JS applications.
A react element is an object that represents a DomNode.
React elements are written using JSX
which is a JavaScript extension,
that allows us to write HTML tags in our JavaScript code.
So let's take a look at what that looks like.
As you can see here in the code, I've written an HTML tag with,
Hello World, inside it.
And I define that to the element variable.
This is something that JSX allows us to do.
Now that we've created our react element,
how do we render it to the page?
Well, if we first look at HTML we'll see that we have a single
div element within id of roots.
We can target this div and embed our react element inside of it.
And we can do that with the ReactDom.render method.
Let me show you how that works.
The ReactDom.render method takes in two arguments.
The first being the element that we're trying to render, and
the second being the target.
So, if we target that root element we saw earlier and
we embed our react element,
we can see that Hello World is now rendered to the page.
So once a DOM is rendered it will remain the same
until another ReactDOM.render method is called.
So, if we happen to change this element variable,
the page would not re-render.
We will have to recall another render method.
